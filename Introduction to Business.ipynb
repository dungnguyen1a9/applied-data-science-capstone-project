    "-\tAs we all know, for big cities in the developed country, its population is often high. The higher population will usually lead to many social problems.

    "-\tNew York City and City of Toronto population data from Kaggle and Wikipedia dataset respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "    <b>• Part 2 :</b>\n",
    "    1. Desired Data\n",
    "- New York City Census data. This data will be used to explore New York economic potentials\n",
    "- Venues location data. This data is used to see which location that business owner should open their business.\n",

    "\n",
    "    5. Model Development – K-clustering\n",
    "- K- clustering is chosen because it can show the most common venues in the location and from that information, we can determine that if we should open restaurant or office. Besides that, the number of cluster will be used is five.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Neighborhood Selection\n",
    "- The neighborhood for opening restaurant will be chosen is not the one has highest number of restaurants in the location because it is highly competitive and the owner also can not optimize their revenue based on game theory. In addition, for opening restaurant, we should look for location that has high number of supermarkets or markets nearby because it will allow restaurant maintain low cost food but high quality. For opening office, it will be the best to open office at location that has cafe shop, fast food or restaurants as common venues since it will be optimize the convenience."
